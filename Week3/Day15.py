        2. A command-line tool (e.g., a text-based game, a file organizer)
        3. A data analysis project (e.g., analyzing a dataset and visualizing the results)
Todo Task 2: Define the Project Requirements
    Write down the requirements and features you want to include in your project. This could be in the form of user stories, a feature list, or a basic outline.
Todo Task 3: Plan the Project Structure
    Outline the structure of your project. Decide on the main components, modules, and files you'll need.
Todo Task 4: Set Up the Project Repository
    - Initialize a new Git repository for your project.
    - Create the necessary directories and files as per your project structure.
    - Add a README.md file with an initial description of your project.
Todo Task 5: Create a Development Plan
    - Break down the tasks you need to complete into smaller, manageable chunks.
    - Create a timeline for completing these tasks over the next six days.
