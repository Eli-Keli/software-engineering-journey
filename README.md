## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/software-engineering-journey.git
   cd software-engineering-journey


You can now add this updated `README.md` to your repository:

1. Create or edit the `README.md` file in your repository:
   ```bash
   nano README.md
